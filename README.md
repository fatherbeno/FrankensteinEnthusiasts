# FrankensteinEnthusiasts
 This project is an attempt for me to try and improve on my C++ skills in UE4. So I am digitizing an old card game idea that I had made, Frankenstein Enthusiasts. It is a game in which two scientists battle it out with their own monster to see who is Frankenstein's most faithful follower!
